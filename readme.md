# Color Website :musical_note:

This was a website I made for a class called Web Design at CSUMB. It is a hand coded website that creates a basic visual representation of the colors of music, based on the name of a song. 

This project uses HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Javascript, and the Amplitude JS audio library.
